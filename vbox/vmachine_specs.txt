# obviously, it's retarded to keep vmimages in git, so here is a spec file for used vmachines
VirtualBox : v 5.10 (obviously bugged, but it seems possible to found workaround for every problem).
1. Linux host: Debian 8.2 (3.16.0-4-amd64)
    a) INetSIM;
    b) Configure to be inner network's default gateway;
    c) Some script to clear and get logs after running;
2. Windows host: Windows 7 x86 (since we are using Immunity, and it doesn't support x64 executables)
    a) Immunity Debugger (with custom PyCommands added + change imm config auto analysis of main module = 0, config sfx options));
    b) ApateDNS (to redirect all DNS requests to Linux host);
    c) Python (obviously, version, supported by Imm - 2.7.1);
    d) Installed pywin32
    e) check using Paranoid fish (for every Windows VM run python tools/HideVBox/camouflage.py <list of vm names>).
    f) install .Net 4.5 4.0.1 etc.(required for viruses, else won't run ...)
    g) turn off UAC;
    h) turn off Windows Firewall (autoagree on all connections);
