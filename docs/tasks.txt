1)  a) Choose what to trace -> look apitrace.py # kernel32 tracing supplemented by user32, since some viruses obviously don't use kernel32
    b) Classify api by libs/ args.
    d) Expand arguments lookup in apicalls for different important functions -> done some, look at process creation routines

3) a)Following new processes/threads -> look apitrace.py, it's ready implementation
   b)Maybe add functions_hooker.add(funcaddr...) on GetProcAddress (run until return -> capture string with pointer in eax ? )
   c)Self-modifying code vs breakpoints : look closely;
