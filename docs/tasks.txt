1)  a) InetSim default files change.
    b) Anti-VM detection tool add to Image and reqs. ( force size of C:/ to >50 GB ?)

2)  a) Choose what to trace -> look apitrace.py # kernel32 tracing supplemented by user32, since some viruses obviously don't use kernel32
    b) Classify api by libs/ args.
    c) Dict for those classified apis to fit in Pandas dframe
    d) Expand arguments lookup in apicalls for different important functions, like GetDirectory -> look for systempaths in it
    e) Look at UPX'ed run results -> investigate further (seems, Imm founds out it's packed).

3) Following new processes/threads -> look apitrace.py, it's ready implementation
